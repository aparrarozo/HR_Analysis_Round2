# HR_Analysis_Employee_Attrition

This model was used to predict employee attrition for a human resources project I worked in during the Ironhack Bootcamp in March 2022. 

# Problem Statement 
In a large pharma company, 15 % of employees leave every year. This generates large costs in finding and training new staff as well as delaying projects. The goal of the study is to find out the most influential factors that predict employee attrition and subsecuently suggest improvements on the hiring criteria and work conditions for a better retention rate.
