This is new attempt at improving the model used to predict employee attrition for a human resources project I worked in during the Ironhack Bootcamp in March 2022. 

Problem Statement: In a large pharma company, 15 % of employees leave every year. This generates large costs in finding and training new staff as well as delaying projects.

Goal of the study: Finding out the most influential factors that predict employee attrition. Suggest improvements on the hiring criteria and work conditions for a better retention rate.

Data set: Source Kaggle 4410 observations, 27 columns ( 5 different datasets): employee survey, information about the working conditions and about the type of work of each employee, manager survey, daily working hours (in 2015).
